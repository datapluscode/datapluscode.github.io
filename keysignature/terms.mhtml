n. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it v=
ery clear to you exactly what you=E2=80=99re paying for. Whilst the develop=
er will make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information that th=
e app provides, the app is provided for free on a best efforts basis, and t=

ecommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process=
 of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official =
operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to mal=
ware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone=E2=80=99s security f=

at the developer will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the=
 app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connec=
tion can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but the dev=
eloper cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functiona=
lity if you don=E2=80=99t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don=E2=80=99t have =
any of your data allowance left.</span></p><p class=3D"c0 c1"><span class=

a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data f=
or the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third p=
arty charges. In using the app, you=E2=80=99re accepting responsibility for=
 any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outsid=
e of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data =
roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you=E2=80=99=

 is updated and correct at all times, we may rely on third parties to provi=

 and you=E2=80=99ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using =
the app. The developer does not promise that it will always update the app =
so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that yo=
u have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept upda=

 your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malici=

not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the =
app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or =
provided by your mobile network provider, but the developer cannot take res=

 app, you=E2=80=99re accepting responsibility for any such charges, includi=

i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not th=

However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offer=

son. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it=
 very clear to you exactly what you=E2=80=99re paying for. Whilst the devel=
oper will make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information that =
the app provides, the app is provided for free on a best efforts basis, and=

recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the proces=
s of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official=
 operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to ma=

veloper cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full function=
ality if you don=E2=80=99t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don=E2=80=99t have=

or the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third p=
arty charges. In using the app, you=E2=80=99re accepting responsibility for=
 any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outsid=
